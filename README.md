# DoubleClick Campaign Manager WDC [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tableau-mkt/dcm-dfa-wdc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tableau-mkt/dcm-dfa-wdc)

### Running this WDC
If at all possible, we recommend using the [hosted version of this WDC](https://dcm-dfa-wdc.herokuapp.com/).

If you'd like to run this locally or deploy it yourself, you will need to do the following:

- Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#installing-the-cli)
  installed.
- [Register an application with Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2WebServer#creatingcred)
  - Set up your client's Redirect URL(s) to include http://localhost:9001 (or whatever host/port you will be running on)
  - Note the Client ID and Client Secret for your application.
- Clone this repository's code locally and run:
  - `npm install`
  - `grunt build`
- Set some environment variables (instructions may differ per hosting provider):
```sh
export GCLIENT_ID='Your Google App Client ID Here'
export GCLIENT_SECRET='Your Google App Client Secret Here'
export GREDIRECT_URL='http://localhost:9001' # or the URL where your copy of the WDC can be accessed
export PORT='9001' # or the poart that your app will respond on
```
- Then run `npm start`, which will make your app available at http://localhost:9001
